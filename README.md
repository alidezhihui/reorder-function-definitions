# Code Transformation: Function Definitions Reordering

This program produces multiple invariant of a python program by rearranging the order of function definitions, leveraing Python's AST module, while preserving the position of non-functional code blocks.

The purpose it to generate multiple program invariants to train robust LLMs for code understanding.
